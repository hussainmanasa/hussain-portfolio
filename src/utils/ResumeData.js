  about:
    "You can also call me an Innovative Frontend Developer. Someone who loves to build scalable and maintainable Web and Mobile Apps. I don't define myself by the work I've done rather I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. Learning is one the strengths which I prefer tocontinue throughout and keep challenging myself. \n\n Being the youth am fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm. I'm easily inspired and willing to follow my fascinations wherever they take me. I'm a very multi-talented, expressive, passionate with natural ability to inspire and motivate. \n\n Curently working with TCS as a UI developer and in my spare time you'll find me doing photography or buffering some latest episodes on OTT platforms.",
